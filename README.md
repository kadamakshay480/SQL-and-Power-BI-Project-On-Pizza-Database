# SQL-and-Power-BI-Project-On-Pizza-Database

In a dynamic SQL and Power BI project centered around a pizza database, data integration is seamlessly

Power BI then visually transforms this data into insightful dashboards and reports, providing
stakeholders with a comprehensive view of pizza sales, customer preferences, and operational trends,
ultimately enhancing decision-making processes within the pizza business.
